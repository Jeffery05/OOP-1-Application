# OOP-1-Application
Hi there! This program is a basic java class thatâ€™s supposed to simulate an airplane. It can perform certain airplane functions, such as taking off, landing, and loading passengers. It also contains airplane attributes, such as door status, gas level and the number of passengers. Have a look!

Also, an airplane tester class is also included, to run through the operations that an airplane makes every flight. Try it out!
